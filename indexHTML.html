<div class="intro">
    Howdy! My name is Josh Mueck and I am an undergraduate computer science major at Texas A&M University and am from the Woodlands, TX. I am also concurrently doing my masterâ€™s of science in quantitative finance at Texas A&M. I am hard-working and am passionate about what I do and engage in computer creativity for higher efficiency. I really value working together in teams as it spurs me on to be the best version of myself and challenges me to achieve my highest potential. Responsibility, integrity, and diligence are qualities I value and look for in my team members and work to exhibit myself. In the past, I interned at the Woodlands Christian Academy technology department, where I conducted ~50 Apple Macbooks, iPads, iMacs, and Apple Pencils repairs per month, and also troubleshot campus internet and phone systems to keep technology in use and functioning properly. Currently, I am assisting in developing in integrating image recognition into a chatbot specifically designed for ophthalmology. In the future, I am looking to delve further into the realm of machine learning and AI and achieve my Tensorflow certification from Google. Master's Program Hiring Site:

<div class="outside">
    Outside of computer science, I have numerous other interests. These include disc golf, bonsai, soccer, NBA basketball, National Parks, and 3D printing. I have visited over 30 National Parks with my family ranging from the Grand Canyon in Arizona to the Gates of the Arctic in Alaska. I am a Houston Rockets fan and love keeping up with the NBA. My greatest love in sports is soccer and disc golf. I enjoy playing soccer in intramurals and enjoy supporting 1. FC Koln in the Bundesliga, Brighton and Hove Albion in the Premier League, and the Houston Dynamo in the MLS. On par with soccer is disc golf. I have been playing disc golf for around 3 years. I am sponsored by Elevation Disc Golf and will be starting my second year as part of their team this year. I am the president of the Texas A&M Disc Golf Club team and play on the team as well and have traveled across Texas and to North Carolina to play tournaments. I am very passionate about disc golf and love getting into the science behind the discs and the marketing surrounding it.
